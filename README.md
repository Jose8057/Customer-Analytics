# Customer-Analytics
The objective of this project is to find the best model to predict customer churn based on the historical data from a Telcompany, and this model will be able to map the new data ingest from the business.

What is Customer Churn? Customer Churn is also known as customer attrition, is when a customer stops buying from a brand or discontinues the subscription. Customer churn is measured by a customer churn rate, a business metric that calculates the percentage of customers who stop doing business with a company over a given period. Understanding customer churn is essential to evaluate the health of the business.

Customer Churn Rate = (Customers lost during the period/Total customers at the start of the period)*100

Through the dataset analytics, I will attempt to find the best model to accurately predict the Customer Churn and solve some of the key business challenges regarding customer attrition, such as

(1) Detect customers who are highly likely to leave the organization?

(2) what are key indicators of a customer churn?

(3) what strategies can be implemented based on the results to prevent customer churn?
